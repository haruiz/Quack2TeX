# Quack2Tex 🦆

Ever found yourself battling with equations while writing papers in LaTeX, wishing there was a way to just snap a picture and boom—LaTeX code? Well, I did too. After too many late nights and too much coffee, I finally decided to do something about it. The result? Quack2Tex.

**Quack2Tex** is a handy tool that facilitates turning images of math equations and charts into LaTeX code, quickly and easily!. But it doesn't stop there! It also has cool features like guessing the location from a photo, identifying recipes from food pictures, and explaining code from images. Rendered as a floating menu on your screen, Quack2Tex is always at your fingertips, making it easy to access anytime you need it.

## 🧠 Powered By

Under the hood, Quack2Tex  leverages state-of-the-art multimodal models like Gemini, GPT-4o, and Lava to analyze the content in the images. Whether you're converting handwritten notes into LaTeX or identifying the location of a stunning sunset photo, Quack2Tex has you covered.

## 🔧 Installation

To get started with Quack2Tex, follow these steps:

```bash
pip install quack2tex
```

## 📚 Usage

You can run **Quack2Tex** in multiple ways depending on your preference.

### 🏁 Quick Start (via terminal)

Run the app with your API keys as command-line options:

```bash
quack2tex --gemini-api-key <your_gemini_api_key> \
          --openai-api-key <your_openai_api_key> \
          --anthropic-api-key <your_anthropic_api_key> \
          --groq-api-key <your_groq_api_key>
```

### 🌱 Alternative: Using Environment Variables

You can set the API keys as environment variables:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_anthropic_api_key>
export GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key>

quack2tex
```

### 📄 `.env` File Support

You can also create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following contents:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_anthropic_api_key>
GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key>
```

The app will automatically load these variables using `python-dotenv`.

### 🛠️ Help & Options

To explore all available options:

```bash
quack2tex --help
```

### 🧠 Optional: Using LLava Models via Ollama

Quack2Tex also supports LLava models via the [Ollama API](https://ollama.com). Be sure to have Ollama running and properly configured.

### 🐍 Running from Python

You can also run the app programmatically. Check out the `main.py` file for an example:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
import quack2tex
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
# Run the app
quack2tex.run_app()
```

Let me know if you'd like to include examples, expected outputs, or Docker support!
